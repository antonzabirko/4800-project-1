/**
 * The main Gym.js class. It encapsulates an environment with
 * arbitrary behind-the-scenes dynamics. An environment can be
 * partially or fully observed.
 *
 * This class is derived from OpenAI's [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)
 * and thus the API is very similar and in most cases the same. The key
 * differences are as follows:
 * - gym.js uses tensorflow.js for tensor manipulation instead of numpy.
 *   As a result, all of the returned datatypes are `tf.Tensor` in place
 *   of `np.array`.
 * - The `render` method prints the environment to the console. `renderHTML`
 *   either returns an HTML string or, in the case of a Phaser env, renders
 *   on the canvas.
 *
 *  The main API methods that users of this class need to know are:
 *   - step
 *   - reset
 *   - render
 *   - close
 *   - seed
 *
 *  And set the following attributes:
 *   - `action_space`: The Space object corresponding to valid actions
 *   - `observation_space`: The Space object corresponding to valid observations
 *   - `reward_range`: A tuple corresponding to the min and max possible rewards
