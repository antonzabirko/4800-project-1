    <h1>Elements of Deep RL</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>A deep reinforcement learning model is a combination of algorithms which interact with an environment
    to achieve a control function.</p>

    <h2>Policy</h2>
    <p>A policy defines the learning agent's way of behaving at a given time.
        Roughly speaking, a policy is a mapping from perceived states of the
        environment to actions to be taken when in those states.</p>
    <h2>Value Function</h2>
    <p>In a controlled dynamical system, the value function represents the optimal payoff of the system over the
        interval [t, T] when started at the time-t state variable x(t)=x.
